### What advice would you give to future GSoC students?

Slowly producing carefully crafted and clean code is almost always preferable to quick and hasty code. The former will be a breathe to review while the latter will require a lot of time from the mentors.

Check how the repository codebase you are contributing to is written and read its contribution guide. Adhere to its style so that your code submission is consistent with it and appears as if it had been written by the core contributors themselves.

Finally, adopting a sharp commit etiquette and keeping a clean VCS history is paramount. This is the first trace you will leave in the repository. If there is a single important word to me to capture software development, "elegance" it must be. Your work must strive for elegance, software development is an art form.

### What advice would you give to future GSoC mentors?

Do not underestimate the time required to mentor a student. It is easy to assume that the student will get a good grasp of the project but sometimes it is not the case.

Be prepared to explain things multiple times if required and be patient and your student will have a great time working with you!

### Anything else youâ€™d like to tell Google or suggestions on how we could improve the program?

This was a great experience and we all learnt a lot. It would be nice to have an option for work having been partially merged in the "Has Student's code been merged?" question just above. Besides this small minute detail, the program is really well organised and we don't have anything to suggest except keeping it up! Thanks to NumFOCUS and Google!
